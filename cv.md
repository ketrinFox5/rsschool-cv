3. **My goal (and desire)** is to become a cool front-end developer, and in general an excellent programmer. For this, I constantly study and develop, not only as a developer, but also as a person. I have noticed from my own experience, albeit small, that if a person is driven by a big dream and a strong desire, he will not be afraid of the amount of new information that he will need to study, he will continue to learn despite this and not stop halfway. Although it also requires patience. I think I can attribute myself to this kind of people. As they say, programmers learn all their lives.
4. *Skills*:
 - **Programming languages:** familiar with ะก#, actively learning JavaScript (JQuery);
 - **HTML5/CSS3:** methodology BEM, framework Bootstrap 4, devtools, version control Git;

5. Tasks implemented on the basis of JavaScript:
 - Create your own structure condition. Minimum number of conditions in one structure: 5

   `var number1 = 5;
    var number2 = 0;
    var number3 = -1;
    var number4 = 100;
    var number5 = 102;
    var number6 = 50;`

    `function check(number) {
      if (number > 0 && number <= 100  && number != 0 && (number != 50 || number == 55)) {
        console.log('The number passed the test' + ' ' + number);
      } else {
        console.log('Number failed check' + ' ' + number);
      }
    }`

    `check(number1); // The number passed the test
    check(number2); // Number failed check
    check(number3); // Number failed check
    check(number4); // The number passed the test
    check(number5); // Number failed check
    check(number6); // Number failed check`

  - Output to console using WHILE loop, all odd numbers from 30 to 40

    `var n = 30;
     while (n <= 40) {
       if (n % 2 == 1) {
         console.log(n);
       }
       n++;
     }`

  - Output to console using FOR loop, all even numbers from 70 to 40. The first even number must be 70.

      `for (var i = 70; i <= 70 && i >= 40; i--) {
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
          console.log(i);
        }
      }`

6. I have completed an [online course](https://wayup.in/library/course7) on HTML/CSS/JS
(this is my [thesis](https://github.com/ketrinkash/diplom-project)).
And this is my [portfolio](https://github.com/ketrinkash/portfolio) (but it is still in development)
7. Also, I attended a student breakfast and training open day in Epam, it-MeetUp at SimbirSoft in front-end direction.

8. Studying English from school, the university had profile English for programmer-engineers.
